📌 Title

How I Built a Social Media App with React

📝 Introduction

In 2024, I developed a Social Media App to replicate basic social platform features like posting, editing, and live feed updates. The main objective was to practice CRUD operations, improve React state management, and build a responsive user experience.

🛠️ Tech Stack

React JS – for building the UI.

Tailwind CSS – for styling and responsiveness.

JavaScript (ES6) – for app logic.

Mock API / Local Storage – for managing posts and data persistence.

🔨 Features

✍️ Full CRUD Operations – Create, edit, delete, and view posts.

⚡ Real-Time Updates – Posts instantly reflect in the feed using React hooks.

💬 Interactive UI – Smooth user engagement with instant feedback.

📱 Responsive Design – Optimized for mobile and desktop.

🧩 Challenges & Solutions

Challenge: Handling Real-Time Post Updates

Keeping posts synced with the feed was tricky.

✅ Solution: Used React hooks to manage state efficiently and simulate real-time updates.

Challenge: Implementing CRUD Without Conflicts

Multiple states caused update errors.

✅ Solution: Used controlled components with consistent state management.

Challenge: Responsive UI Across Devices

Ensuring a mobile-first design was challenging.

✅ Solution: Applied Tailwind’s responsive utilities and tested across breakpoints.

🎯 Outcome

This project enhanced my React development skills, particularly in state management and CRUD handling, while also sharpening my UI/UX design approach for dynamic and interactive applications.
